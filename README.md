# Flutter BMI_Calculator App

I have just finished developing a BMI Calculator app using Flutter. This project was incredibly helpful, as I learned and implemented several new things such as:

- How to use Flutter Themes
- How to Refactor Flutter Widgets
- Creating Custom Flutter Widgets
- Building Flutter Widgets From Scratch
- Developing Multi-Screen Apps using Routes and Navigation
